# Database Narritive

For this assignment I chose to use the final project from the CS-340 class for client/server development. The main goal of the project was to create a database with user authentication and restrict access to certain user logins. In the assignment I created an admin account that could access all and modify all databases in the mongo shell, while I created a separate user account that could only access a specific database that would be able to read and modify the assigned database to that account; I felt that this assignment best shows what I am capable of achieving in dealing with database management. I feel like security is a growing concern in the computer science field, and I show an example of password protecting the accounts we used in the database creation that would require a password and the username to login to the databases. In this assignment we took a CSV (comma separated values) file and created an organized database for all the entries from the CSV file. I also created queries that would help search through the collection of data to return important data used for research. I plan to utilize an HTML user interface for this database so the user will have an application type program that will make their experience that much more user friendly that would enhance this project.

This database that I am using is being completed in MongoDB and using python in the Jupyter notebook. The only issue I am having with the enhancement is that I am trying to incorporate some visual items and they don’t want to show up, even though I have checked the syntax and I am able to get the code to run. I’m not sure if I am having a formatting issue, or if there is a conflict with the program I am using, maybe there is an incompatibility with programs. I also found some interesting ways to interacting with the data base to create some additional features in the program to make the database even more accessible to any user. I found a lot of joy actually creating a HTML interface with a project I have worked on; I have never really worked with anything of the sort before! Being able to take something I have made in school and create a new experience with that assignment to showcase my abilities in the computer science field is rewarding.
