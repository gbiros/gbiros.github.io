The artifact that I felt best showed my ability to participate in software and design processes is the project from the CS-340 class that is Visual Studios and OpenGL. When I began this project, I remember feeling overwhelmed as I had not had any real experience with any of the tools we used for this project. We were using C++ to write the source code, in the Visual Studios application, and the OpenGL API. In the eight-week course I was really learning three new things and I had to master the three items to complete the final project. The objective of the course was to recreate a scene in the visual studio environment using 3D shapes. We also used shader programs, and texture programs to give the objects the same appearance as they are in the real world as in the environment. This was a demanding project because of all the different dynamics in this project, to complete this in an organized fashion, was a real accomplishment for me, and for this reason displays my ability integrate software design and engineering.

I felt the one enhancement I could make that would strengthen the credibility of my ability to work in this field was to convert the project from one language to another. What I didnâ€™t realize was that OpenGL was specific to C++ and could not convert the assignment to Java like I had originally planned. So, I instead converted the file to work in WebGL, which is a browser friendly API. WebGL is based on OpenGL which is a JavaScript API. Not quite what I had originally planned but I felt that this is a sufficient alternative to represent my skills in the software design and engineering area. I feel like with the amount of time I spent on learning OpenGL syntax, I would probably execute this project more efficiently if I had the same amount of time that I had as when I learned OpenGL. This is something I am going to invest more time into as this seems to be a very effective tool in the field of 3D design and game design, which is a field I could see myself in. Thankfully, because WebGL is based off OpenGL they are very similar in set up and execution. This includes shader programs, texture programs, drawing elements so this was a straightforward project. I only included the CPP file as this is the only part of the project that really changed.
