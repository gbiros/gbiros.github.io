This artifact I chose as it best shows skills that align with algorithms and data structures. I have created a small program that would store data entries in an array list. This assignment was based on a much simpler project that uses basic algorithms and creates an array from the values entered by the user, that would organize appointments that met the conditions of the programs. There are conditions that shouldn’t pass like duplicate entries, and the data being entered should meet the format for the entries; this is outlined in the source code so if the format doesn’t meet the requirements, then it will not enter the data entry into the array and will let the user know why it wasn’t entered into the array. These conditions are created by if statements that will check the entry for all conditions to make sure they have been entered correctly. For those reasons is why I have decided to include this in my ePortfolio. 
	
I do not remember the course that I completed this assignment for, but in the same class I completed a very simple assignment that was used for storing tasks into an array with some unique data associated with those entries. For the assignment I am using in my ePortfolio, I have instead made the assignment more applicable to the real world. Essentially, I have enhanced the basic project into a program that can be used for an appointment system that will track patients and their appointment dates and times. I think this improves my artifact by taking a simple program that was just used as an exercise in a class and turning it into a real world application that could be used in a business shows my ability to develop basic programs that can be used. The array that we are storing data in is the main reason I chose this assignment for the algorithm and data structure assignment. In this assignment the array will create appointment data entries into an array, and we don’t want to duplicate entries so we create conditions that will not allow duplicate entries be made. I think one I will change about my final assignment is add a data piece for the name of the patient into the entry to add another dynamic to the array list. I included JUnit tests to prove the program works, it has entries that should not meet requirements for the data entries and will not add that entry to the array. This is just another form of code review that makes the product more effective and helps prove the quality of the product. 
	
  
 I did not have any problem with this assignment. I think one aspect that can be difficult to dial in is generally creating the source code without client requirements. If there was a set of requirements that the customer was looking for then it would be easier to develop the project, but without this, it is hard to advertise this to all potential clients if they don’t know that I can integrate their needs into the project. I will continue to think of things I can add into the array that would make this more appealing of a data array to clients, or potential employers.
